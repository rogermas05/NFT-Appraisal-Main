**Estimating the Current Price of the NFT 'World Of Women'**

Based on the analysis of recent sales history, historical price fluctuations, market trends, and rarity, the current price of the NFT 'World Of Women' is estimated to be around **$0.30-$0.40 USD**.

**Recent Sales History**

The most recent sales of the NFT were recorded on March 5, 2025, at $0.338, which is relatively close to the previous sales prices, indicating a stable price range in the recent past. However, the data also shows a significant price fluctuation, with prices ranging from $0.07 to $7.80. This indicates that the NFT has experienced both high and low points in its price history, which may suggest a potential correction or a market downturn.

**Historical Price Fluctuations and Market Trends**

The price of $0.338 is significantly lower than the peak price of $7.80, which was recorded in April 2022. This suggests that the market for this NFT has experienced a decline since then. The broader NFT market has also experienced a cooling period since the speculative highs of 2021-2022, with many collections experiencing declining prices.

**Rarity and Demand**

The rarity rank of 6665 and the rarity percentage of 66.65% suggest that this NFT is not among the rarest in the collection. This moderate rarity, combined with declining demand for the collection over time, contributes to its lower valuation.

**Market Context**

The current price of $0.30-$0.40 USD is likely to be the most relevant for the current date, March 2025. This estimate is based on the assumption that the market has adjusted to the new price range and is stabilizing.

**Factors Influencing Price**

Several factors may influence the actual price of the NFT, including:

1. **Market Sentiment**: The overall sentiment of the market and the perception of the collection may impact the price.
2. **Sales Volume**: An increase in sales volume could lead to a higher price, while a decrease in sales volume may result in a lower price.
3. **New Developments**: Any new developments, such as updates to the collection or changes in the underlying technology, may impact the price.
4. **Competing NFTs**: The prices of competing NFTs in the same collection or from other collections may influence the price of this NFT.

**Conclusion**

While the estimated price of $0.30-$0.40 USD is based on the analysis of recent sales history, historical price fluctuations, market trends, and rarity, it is essential to note that the actual price may vary depending on various factors. The estimated price range provides a reasonable estimate for the current date, but the actual price may differ.

**Model Disagreements**

The models provide slightly different estimates, with some models suggesting a higher price range of $0.35-$0.40 USD, while others suggest a lower price range of $0.30-$0.35 USD. These discrepancies may be due to differences in the data used, the analysis performed, or the assumptions made. For example, the **deepseek/deepseek-chat** model provides a more detailed explanation of the recent sales history and historical price fluctuations, which may contribute to its higher estimate. However, the **qwen/qwen-vl-plus** model provides a more concise summary of the market context and factors influencing price, which may contribute to its lower estimate.

Overall, the estimated price range of $0.30-$0.40 USD provides a reasonable estimate for the current date, and the actual price may vary depending on various factors.
