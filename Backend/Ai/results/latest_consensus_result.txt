**Current NFT Price: $3.93**

After analyzing the provided sales history data, we've identified several key trends that have contributed to our revised estimate of $3.93.

**Recent Price Movement:** The price has been steadily increasing since the sale on March 5, 2023, with a recent price of $3.93. This upward trend suggests that the NFT remains in high demand.

**Rarity and Demand:** The World Of Women NFT is ranked 6665th in rarity, which could contribute to its relatively high price. However, the rarity percentage of 66.65% indicates that it's not extremely rare, which might limit its price appreciation.

**Sales Volatility:** The sales history shows significant price fluctuations, with prices ranging from $0.07 to $3.96. This volatility suggests that market conditions and demand can be unpredictable, making it challenging to estimate the future price.

**Long-term Trend:** Despite the recent upward trend, the long-term trend is more complex. The price has dropped significantly since its peak in 2022, which might indicate that the market has adjusted to the NFT's value.
