CHALLENGE_PROMPTS = [
    "Your price estimate seems high. Are you sure about your approach? Please generate your output again reflecting any change if you think it is necessary.",
    
    "Your price estimate seems low compared to the rarity of this NFT. How would your estimate change if you weighted rarity more heavily?",
    
    "Have you fully accounted for market volatility in your analysis. How confident are you in your estimate given recent fluctuations in the NFT market?",
    
    "Your analysis lacks detailed consideration of comparable NFTs in this collection. Can you revise your estimate after considering similar items?",
    
    "The sales history you cite may not be representative of the current market. What if recent transactions are outliers rather than indicators of a trend?",
    
    "You've placed significant weight on historical prices, but NFT markets often experience rapid shifts. How would your estimate change if you focused more on recent data?",
    
    "Your reasoning seems to overweight specific factors while neglecting others. Please reconsider with a more balanced approach to market conditions, rarity, and historical data.",
    
    "I'm not convinced by your price justification. Can you provide a more thorough analysis that addresses both bullish and bearish scenarios?",
    
    "The NFT's rarity score may have different implications than you've stated. How would your estimate change if this NFT's rarity was actually in higher demand?",
    
    "Your price estimate doesn't seem to account for the overall trend in this collection's floor price. How would incorporating this factor affect your valuation?"
